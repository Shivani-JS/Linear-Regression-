# Linear-Regression-
Sales of various Advertisement(TV,Radio,Newspaper)  mediums were predicted by applying Linear Regression in Python.
Visualization was performed using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
The data was tested to satisfy the assumption of Linear Regression. 
Such as Independence of Variables. Linearity using Scatter Plot. Normality using Histogram - Skewness in the data was handled by applying Log1 Transformation. Multicolinearity using Heat Map. VIF by Python Statsmodels. 
Further applied the Linear Regression Model From sklearn. 
The model was evaluated on metrics such as R_square Score, RMSE, Adjusted R_square. 
Ridge(L2 Regularization) and Lasso (L1 Regularization) were applied for better variable selection and further improving the efficiency of the Linear Regression model.
OLS model from statsmodel was applied and graphs were plotted
