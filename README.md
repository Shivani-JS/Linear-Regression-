# Linear-Regression-
### Software Requirement:
    -- Jupyter Notebook
    -- Anaconda
    -- Python 3.6 and above
## Data Details:
The data used for this project is an Advertising Data consisting of Independent variables such as 

    -- TV
    -- Radio
    -- Newspaper" 

## Project Description:
For the given Independent variable we need to predict the "Sales"
Visualization was performed using librariessuch as:

    -- Matplotlib 
    -- Seaborn 
    
The data was tested to satisfy the assumption of Linear Regression such as :

    -- Independence of Variables
    -- Linearity using Scatter Plot
    -- Normality using Histogram
    -- Skewness in the data was handled by applying Log1 Transformation. Multicolinearity using Heat Map. VIF by Python Statsmodels
    
Further applied the Linear Regression Model From sklearn. 
The model was evaluated on metrics such as:

    -- R_square Score
    -- RMSE
    -- Adjusted R_square
    
Ridge(L2 Regularization) and Lasso (L1 Regularization) were applied for better variable selection and further improving the efficiency of the Linear Regression model.
OLS model from statsmodel was applied and graphs were plotted.
